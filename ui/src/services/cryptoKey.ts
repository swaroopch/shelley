 * that arrives without one. Put those together and a browser that restores
 * several tabs at once with no cookie yet (Safari reopening a window, or a
 * first visit that opens several tabs) has every tab minting its own session:
 * they share one cookie jar but hold different keys, so each reads keys_meta,
 * sees a stranger's key_id, and wipes the shared IDB stores the others just
 * filled. Net effect: every tab re-downloads its whole conversation,
 * repeatedly, while fighting the others.
 *
 * Serializing the request fixes it with no server-side coordination: the first
 * tab mints the cookie, and every tab after it presents that cookie and so
 * derives the same key.
 *
 * This is mitigation, not a guarantee. The underlying defect is a GET that
 * mints state; clients without Web Locks (and non-browser clients) still race.
 * A server-side fix — deriving the salt from the authenticated session, or
 * making the mint idempotent per session — would fix every client at once.
