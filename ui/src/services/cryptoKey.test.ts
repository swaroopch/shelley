// cryptoKey tests — the cache-key fetch must never strand a caller.
//
// Every conversation load funnels through CacheKeyHolder.ensure(): hydrate()
// awaits it before it can read (or prove absent) the IDB row, and
// ChatInterface only clears its spinner once loadMessages returns. So an
// unbounded wait here is an unbounded spinner there. With several Safari tabs
// on one origin that wait is reachable: on HTTP/1.1 every tab pins one of the
// six per-origin sockets with its SSE stream, and a later tab's key request is
// never dispatched. That is the multi-tab "some tabs hang while loading"
// report these tests pin down.
//
// Deadlines are injected (tens of ms) so the give-up behaviour is asserted
// without sleeping for the production timeout.
//
// Run via `pnpm test` (see scripts/run-tests.mjs).
