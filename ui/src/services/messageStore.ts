// messageStore.ts — IndexedDB-backed per-message cache plus an in-memory
// layer for transient streaming state (tool progress, stream deltas, agent
// working). Components subscribe by conversation_id (or globally) to receive
// updates. Stream events from globalStream.ts flow in via the apply* methods.
//
// Persistence model: write-behind, but per-call atomic. Each public mutator
// updates the in-memory hot map and notifies listeners synchronously, then
// kicks off a single IDB readwrite transaction. The transaction does a true
// read-modify-write of the conversation_meta row in the same tx as the
// message puts, so concurrent writers (other tabs / store instances) cannot
// lose `max_sequence_id_local`.
//
// Completeness model — two distinct "the cache isn't authoritative" flags,
// because they warrant very different repairs:
//
//   hasFullHistory=false  We are missing messages we cannot name. Only a full
//                         GET /api/conversation/<id> can repair it.
//   needsRefresh=true     The cached prefix is complete but may be short: the
//                         server might have grown past our tail (set on stream
//                         reconnect). Repaired by a cheap
//                         ?last_sequence_id=<our max> tail fetch.
//
// Conflating them is a real bug in both directions: a tail fetch starts from
// our cached max, so it can never recover a message missing from the MIDDLE;
// and re-downloading whole conversations on every reconnect costs megabytes.
//
// A hole in the middle is reachable in ordinary use, not just on cache damage.
// /api/stream2 delivers events for ALL conversations, including ones the user
// isn't viewing: cache 1..3 for conversation B, close the tab, let 4..6 be
// written, then open a new tab where a live event delivers 7 for B before B is
// ever focused. Nothing in the sequence bookkeeping notices — local max jumps
// to 7 and typically equals the conversation list's known max, so every
// catch-up counter reports "up to date" over a hole. Hence the join checks in
// upsertMessages, _persistUpsert and mergeRecords/joinsUp, all of which clear
// hasFullHistory (never merely needsRefresh).
//
// Note we do NOT infer completeness from the sequence_id run being
// consecutive: ids legitimately have gaps. db.CopyMessagesForFork copies only
// the fork point's generation while preserving the source sequence_ids, so a
// fork can hold a complete history with holes in it. Lost rows are detected by
// row count instead (ConvMetaRow.message_count).
//
// For the same reason we do not require a cached history to START at sequence
// 1: a fork taken after a compaction legitimately begins well past it. What a
// full REST snapshot establishes is that whatever it returned IS the whole
// history. The one exception is an EMPTY snapshot with live rows grafted on
// top, which establishes nothing — see applyFullHistory.
//
// Hidden tabs never write to IndexedDB (canPersist). IDB locks are
// origin-wide and Safari throttles or suspends background tabs, so a hidden
// tab holding even a one-row readwrite transaction stalls every read the
// visible tab makes — measured at the full 250ms read deadline (and the 3s
// startup deadline) once a handful of tabs were open. Skipping is safe
// because every tab receives every /api/stream2 event: whenever some tab is
// visible, that tab persists the same data. When no tab is visible the disk
// merely lags as an honest prefix, which the existing catch-up paths repair
// cheaply: the conversation list seeds max_sequence_id_known on every page
// load (tail fetch), hydrate unions the disk row with this tab's hot messages
// (mergeRecords), and a later visible append backfills the skipped messages
// from memory before writing (_persistUpsert), so the join check below only
// trips when this tab genuinely never saw the gap.
//
// At-rest encryption (v4): the sensitive payload of each row is AES-GCM
// encrypted with a per-browser key derived server-side from a long-lived
// secret + a session cookie (see services/cryptoKey.ts + server/cache_key.go).
// On open we fetch the key; if the server returns a different key_id than
// the one stored in `meta`, the DB is wiped before use (treats unrelated
// cipher-text as garbage). If the server refuses to release the key (auth
// lost), IDB persistence silently degrades to a no-op — the in-memory hot
// map and the live SSE stream still work; we just don't have offline cache
// until re-auth.
//
// DB schema v4:
//   messages          — keyPath [conversation_id, sequence_id]. Row =
//                       { conversation_id, sequence_id, message_id, iv, ct }.
//                       conversation_id, sequence_id, message_id stay
//                       plaintext (they are keys / indexed). The Message
//                       JSON lives inside ct.
//   conversation_meta — keyPath conversation_id. Row = { conversation_id,
//                       updated_at, iv, ct }. The rest of the meta
//                       (Conversation, sequence bookmarks, …) lives in ct.
//                       updated_at stays plaintext so pruneStale can scan.
//   keys_meta         — singleton row keyed by "current" holding { key_id }.
