description: Use when the user or project guidance (AGENTS.md) asks for a "commit tour", annotated commits, or commit annotations. Produces a narrative walkthrough of a commit's diff, stored as a git note and rendered in Shelley's diff UI.
---

A commit guided tour is a JSON annotation of a commit's diff, stored in the git
note ref `shelley-tour`. Shelley's diff UI shows a badge on annotated commits
and renders the tour: important changes first with commentary, trivial changes
collapsed.

## Workflow

Annotate a commit right after making it. Delegate to a subagent when the commit
is large; pass it the commit hash, the repo directory, and this skill.

Work files-first, then chunks: survey the changed files, plan the narrative
order, and only then read patch bodies — selectively. Never print the full
chunks JSON into your context for anything beyond a small commit.

1. Survey the commit with the chunk index:

   ```
   shelley tour chunks [-C <repo-dir>] -index <commit>
   ```

   This prints the commit subject and one line per suggested chunk — id,
   +adds/-dels, and `@@` header — grouped by file, with no patch bodies.
   Chunks tagged `[trivial: reason]` are provably mechanical (generated
   files, whitespace-only hunks, renames, binaries): the
   scaffold already collapses them, so never read or comment on them.
   Classify the rest into tiers: data model / schema / API first, then core
   logic, tests, and finally boilerplate. Small edits are not pre-marked;
   judge those yourself.

2. Read only the chunks you need to write commentary for:

   ```
   shelley tour chunks [-C <repo-dir>] -text -only 4,7-9 <commit>
   shelley tour chunks [-C <repo-dir>] -text -only path/to/file.go <commit>
   ```

   `-only` takes chunk ids/ranges or a single file path. `-text` prints raw
   patch text with `=== chunk N <file>` separators; without it you get JSON:
   the full `hash`, the commit `subject`, and a `chunks` array of
   `{"id": <id>, "file": "...", "patch": "..."}` objects. Each suggestion is
   a self-contained, git-apply-able fragment: its file headers plus one hunk,
   or the header block alone for a hunkless binary, rename, or mode change.

3. Write the tour JSON to a temp file. Start from a scaffold and reference
   suggested chunks by id — never re-type patch text:

   ```
   shelley tour scaffold [-C <repo-dir>] <commit> > tour.json
   ```

   The scaffold lists every chunk as a `{"ref": <id>}` entry in diff order,
   with generated files and mechanical hunks pre-marked trivial, so coverage is
   guaranteed by construction. Then reorder entries by importance, insert
   headers, and add comments:

   ```json
   {
     "version": 1,
     "title": "Short plain-text title",
     "intro": "Markdown intro: what this commit does and why.",
     "chunks": [
       {"header": "## The data model"},
       {"ref": 4, "comment": "Why this shape matters."},
       {"patch": "diff --git a/server/model.go b/server/model.go\n...", "comment": "A hand-split slice."},
       {"header": "## Supporting changes"},
       {"ref": 0, "trivial": true},
       {"ref": 1, "trivial": true}
     ]
   }
   ```

   Every entry has exactly one of `header`, `ref` (a suggested-chunk id), or
   `patch` (literal patch text, for hand-split hunks). Ref and patch entries
   may also have `comment` and `trivial`. `attach` stores refs resolved to
   their patch text, so the note remains self-contained.

   For big commits, edit the scaffold with a short script that maps ids to
   entries (e.g. `add(14, 'comment')`, `header('## ...')`) rather than
   rewriting it by hand.

4. Verify, then attach:

   ```
   shelley tour verify [-C <repo-dir>] <commit> tour.json
   shelley tour attach [-C <repo-dir>] <commit> tour.json
   ```

   `verify` applies all entries to the commit's parent tree and requires the
   exact commit tree. Gaps, overlaps, duplicate chunks, edited lines, or bad
   headers fail with Git's error text. `attach` verifies and writes the note
   (re-running overwrites; concurrent attaches retry ref locks automatically).
   `shelley tour show <commit>` prints an existing tour.

## Writing a good tour

- **Data model first.** Open with changed types, schemas, formats, or APIs so
  readers understand the shapes involved.
- **Important bits first.** After the data model, order entries by importance, not file
  order: core logic and decisions, tests, then generated files, lock files,
  imports, boilerplate, and renames.
- **Cover the whole diff.** Verification reconstructs the commit tree from the
  parent, so every change must appear exactly once. Check ids off against the
  `-index` listing before verifying.
- Split large suggested hunks into logical patch entries by copying the file
  header block and rewriting each slice's `@@` header. Old starts use parent
  coordinates; new starts use final-file coordinates. Zero context is fine.
  Keep each `\ No newline at end of file` marker with its hunk's last line.
- Entries may be reordered freely, including slices from the same original
  hunk.
- Mark boring patch entries `"trivial": true`; they render collapsed and need
  no comment.
- Use `{"header": "## ..."}` entries as markdown section headings.
- Comments are markdown. Explain why and what to notice rather than restating
  the diff; one to three sentences is usually enough.
- `intro` should state the problem, the approach, and the map of the tour.
- Amending changes the commit hash; re-attach the tour afterward.
