// tool_result rows — an invalid history that a post-crash rehydrate would
// "repair" (insertMissingToolResults) into a corrupted turn, and whose DB
// order would diverge from the order the model actually saw. Persisting at
// take time — the moment the pair enters the model-visible history — is the
// only position where the log stays valid and rehydration is faithful.
// Durability-wise little is at stake: the subagent's response itself is
