# Shelley HTTP/SSE API

This document describes the API contract between a Shelley server and its
clients (the web UI, the iOS app, the CLI in `client/`, and tests). All
routes are mounted under `/api/` unless noted; the version endpoint is at
`/version`.

## Capabilities

```
GET /version
```

Returns build info plus `capabilities` (string list). Capabilities
advertise optional, additive features that clients can opt into when
present; a client that doesn't recognize a capability just doesn't use
it, and an older server that doesn't ship the field is equivalent to
advertising none.

The set is currently empty; it exists as a forward slot so we can add
capabilities later without reshaping the response.

## Stream architecture

The server derives the conversation list from the database and publishes
RFC-6902 JSON Patch diffs on a single unified SSE stream:

- `GET /api/stream2` — unified SSE: per-conversation messages **and**
  conversation-list patches.
- `GET /api/conversations/snapshot` — seed the patch stream with the
  current list and its content hash.
- Previews are embedded in each conversation list row (`preview`,
  `preview_updated_at`).
- `GET /api/conversation/<id>/stream` survives for non-web clients (iOS,
  CLI, tests) but new clients should use `/api/stream2`.

The patch stream is driven exclusively by `Pool.OnCommit`: every
successful write transaction triggers a recompute, and a `recomputeMu`
serializes recomputes so concurrent commits can't publish events out of
order. Each event carries `old_hash`/`new_hash`, letting clients
reconcile their state on every patch.

## Endpoints

### Versioning

- `GET /version` — `{tag, commit, commit_time, capabilities: [...]}`.
- `GET /version-check` — `{has_update, current_tag, latest_tag, ...}`.
- `GET /version-changelog` — markdown changelog.

### Conversation list

Unless noted, results exclude **archived** conversations.

- `GET /api/conversations?limit=&offset=` — top-level (non-subagent)
  unarchived conversations as plain rows. Used by iOS and the CLI.
- `GET /api/conversations/snapshot` — the current unarchived list
  including subagents, plus per-row state (working, git info, subagent
  count, preview) and the patch-stream hash. Used by the web UI on load.
  Response:
  ```json
  {
    "conversations": [ConversationWithState, ...],
    "hash": "<sha256 hex>"
  }
  ```
- `GET /api/conversations/archived` — archived list.
- `POST /api/conversations/new` — create a conversation and post the
  first user message.
- `POST /api/conversations/distill-new-generation` — compact the current
  conversation into the next generation of the same conversation. The
  optional `method` field (`default` or `compact`) is accepted for
  compatibility but is ignored: compaction is always used.

`ConversationWithState` row shape:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `conversation_id`, `slug`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `cwd`, `archived`, `parent_conversation_id`, `model`, `conversation_options`, `current_generation`, `agent_working`, `user_initiated` | DB columns |
| `working` | mirror of `agent_working`, kept for the patch-stream contract |
| `git_repo_root`, `git_worktree_root`, `git_commit`, `git_subject` | optional, from a cached HEAD lookup keyed by `cwd` |
| `subagent_count` | number of subagent conversations whose `parent_conversation_id` matches this row |
| `preview`, `preview_updated_at` | trailing text of the most recent agent message and its timestamp (RFC 3339); empty if no agent reply yet, or if this conversation is outside the 500-most-recent window the server tracks for previews |

### Single conversation

- `GET /api/conversation/<id>` — full message history (compressed).
- `GET /api/conversation/<id>/stream` — **legacy** SSE: messages, state,
  no list patches. Used by iOS, CLI, and Go tests; new clients should
  use `/api/stream2`. Query params:
    - `?last_sequence_id=<n>` — resume from `sequence_id > n`.
    - `?tail=<n>` — first frame contains only the last `n` messages.
  A `{"snapshot_complete": true}` frame follows the initial replay
  and precedes live updates.
- `POST /api/conversation/<id>/chat` — send a user message.
- `POST /api/conversation/<id>/cancel` — interrupt the running loop.
- `POST /api/conversation/<id>/archive` / `unarchive`.
- `POST /api/conversation/<id>/hooks` — register an end-of-turn webhook.
- `GET /api/conversation-by-slug/<slug>` — lookup by slug.

### Unified stream

```
GET /api/stream2?conversation=<id>&conversation_list_hash=<h>&last_sequence_id=<n>
```

SSE stream. A single connection delivers per-conversation events
(messages, tool progress, stream deltas, conversation/state updates) for
**all** active conversations on the server, plus the conversation-list
patch stream. Every per-conversation event carries a top-level
`conversation_id` field for client-side routing.

All query params are optional:

- `conversation` — if set, the first frames replay that conversation's
  message history before live updates begin. It governs **backfill
  only**: live events for every conversation flow regardless.
- `conversation_list_hash` — the `hash` from the most recent snapshot
  or patch event the client successfully applied. The server uses it to
  decide whether to replay history or send a fresh reset event.
- `last_sequence_id`, `tail` — refine the `conversation` backfill, with
  the same semantics as on `/api/conversation/<id>/stream`. A
  `snapshot_complete` frame separates the initial replay (and an empty
  replay on connections without `conversation`) from live updates.

Event payload (`data: <json>`):

```ts
interface StreamResponse {
  // Routing key for per-conversation events. Always set on messages,
  // conversation, conversation_state, context_window_size, tool_progress,
  // and stream_delta. Empty for connection-scoped frames
  // (conversation_list_patch, heartbeat, snapshot_complete) and for
  // global events that already carry their own conversation reference
  // (notification_event).
  conversation_id?: string;

  // Per-conversation event payload. With a single stream serving every
  // active conversation, clients dispatch based on conversation_id.
  messages?: APIMessage[];
  conversation?: Conversation;
  conversation_state?: { conversation_id, working, model };
  context_window_size?: number;
  tool_progress?: ToolProgress;
  stream_delta?: StreamDelta;
  notification_event?: NotificationEvent;

  // Conversation-list patch stream:
  conversation_list_patch?: {
    old_hash: string | null,        // null on a reset event
    new_hash: string,
    patch: RFC6902Op[],             // ops with paths like "/0", "/0/working", etc.
    at: string,                     // RFC 3339
    reset?: true,                   // true for the seed event
  };

  heartbeat?: true;                 // sent every 30s if nothing else to say
  snapshot_complete?: true;         // once, after the initial replay
}
```

The `conversation_list_patch` operates on a document that is exactly the
`conversations` array returned by `/api/conversations/snapshot`. Clients
should:

1. `GET /api/conversations/snapshot` once to obtain `(state, hash)`.
2. Open `/api/stream2?conversation_list_hash=<hash>`.
3. For each `conversation_list_patch` event:
   - If `event.old_hash == null` or `event.reset`, replace local state
     with `event.patch[0].value`.
   - Otherwise, require `event.old_hash == currentHash`; apply
     `event.patch` via RFC 6902; assert `hashList(state) == new_hash`.
   - On any mismatch, drop local state and resume with the snapshot.

Reconnect semantics: the server keeps the last 100 patch events in
memory. If the client's `conversation_list_hash` matches one of those
boundaries, the server replays the missed patches; otherwise it sends a
fresh reset event.

### Git

- `GET /api/git/repos` — repo discovery.
- `GET /api/git/diffs?cwd=` — staged/unstaged file lists.
- `GET /api/git/diffs/<commit>?cwd=` — committed file lists.
- `GET /api/git/file-diff/<path>?cwd=&base=&head=` — unified diff.
- `GET /api/git/graph?cwd=` — commit graph.
- `GET /api/git/commit-detail?cwd=&sha=` — single commit.
- `GET /api/git/commit-messages?cwd=` — recent commit messages.
- `POST /api/git/amend-message` — amend HEAD message.
- `POST /api/git/create-worktree` — `git worktree add`.

### Files & directories

- `GET /api/find-files?dir=&q=&content=skip&include_dirs=true` — fuzzy name
  search. `dir` is absolute; `q` is optional. `include_dirs` is an optional
  boolean (default false); enabling it includes nested and empty folders in
  name results. Invalid or repeated `include_dirs` values return 400.
  Results contain `search_dir` and `matches`; paths are relative to
  `search_dir`. Folder matches have `is_dir: true` and a trailing `/` in
  `path`; file matches omit `is_dir`. `content=only` always returns file-content
  hits, never folders. An explicit existing directory path without a trailing
  slash offers that folder itself when `include_dirs` is true; a trailing
  slash browses inside it. File-only callers retain their existing behavior.
- `GET /api/list-directory?path=` — directory listing.
- `POST /api/create-directory` — `mkdir -p`.
- `POST /api/write-file` — write a file.
- `POST /api/upload` — binary upload (multipart).
- `POST /api/upload/raw?filename=` — binary upload with the file content as
  the request body (no multipart framing). Newer clients prefer this to
  avoid building a multipart body on device. Older servers return 404/405;
  clients should fall back to the multipart endpoint.
- `GET /api/upload/raw` — empty `200 OK` if the server supports the raw
  upload endpoint; clients use this as a capability probe (older servers
  return 404/405).
- `GET /api/read?path=` — read a file (images served as `image/*`).
- `POST /api/validate-cwd` — check whether a path is a valid working
  directory.
- `GET /api/user-agents-md` / `POST` — read/write the per-user
  AGENTS.md.

### Models, tools, notifications

- `GET /api/models` — available models.
- `GET /api/tools` — registered tool definitions.
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/custom-models[/<id>]` — custom model CRUD.
- `POST /api/custom-models-test` — test a custom model config.
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/notification-channels[/<id>]`,
  `GET /api/notification-channel-types` — notification CRUD.

### Shell

- `WS /api/exec-ws?cwd=` — websocket for an interactive shell session.
  `cmd=` starts a new persistent session; `term_id=` reattaches to an existing
  one and never reruns the command. `conversation_id=` records which
  conversation owns a newly spawned terminal.
- `GET /api/terminals` — all persistent terminals, unfiltered.
  `conversation_id` is the owning conversation, or `null` for a terminal shown
  in every conversation.
- `PUT /api/terminals/<id>/scope` — move a terminal between conversations.
  Body `{"conversation_id": "<id>"}` confines it to that conversation;
  `{"conversation_id": null}` shows it in all of them. `null` is the only
  accepted spelling of global: an absent field or an empty string is a 400.
  Returns the updated terminal.
- `DELETE /api/terminals/<id>`, `POST /api/terminals/<id>/kill` — terminate a
  terminal and drop its record.

### Debug

- `GET /debug/conversations` — HTML dump of the conversation list.
- `GET /debug/conversation-stream` — HTML viewer over the patch stream.
- `GET /debug/conversation-stream/history` — JSON dump of the last 100
  patch events.
