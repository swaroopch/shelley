package models

// --- Model tiers -----------------------------------------------------------
//
// The catalog keeps growing, and many models are strictly obviated by a newer
// or better sibling that we also offer. Rather than drop the older models
// (people may still want them, and custom configs may pin them), we sort them
// into two tiers:
//
//   - Tier 1: the models worth surfacing prominently. Nothing we also offer
//     clearly supersedes them.
//   - Tier 2: models that are "overshadowed" by another model in the same
//     available set, or models not present in Shelley's built-in catalog. Still
//     selectable, just tucked behind a "more models" affordance in the UI and
//     omitted from the subagent tool's model enum.
//
// The shadow relationships below are hand-curated. Each pair reads
// "better shadows worse": if `better` is present in the available set, then
// `worse` is demoted to tier 2. A known model that is never shadowed by an
// available model stays in tier 1. Unknown integration models default to tier 2.

const (
	Tier1 = 1
	Tier2 = 2
)

// shadowPair records that model `Better` overshadows model `Worse`: when both
// are available, `Worse` drops to tier 2.
type shadowPair struct {
	Better string
	Worse  string
}

// shadowPairs is the curated list of "better shadows worse" relationships.
// See the package doc above for the semantics. IDs that aren't in the catalog
// (e.g. a not-yet-launched release) are harmless: they simply never match an
// available model.
var shadowPairs = []shadowPair{
	// Clear supersessions within a family.
